SarcasmAI – Sarcasm Detection Web Application

SarcasmAI is a web-based application designed to analyze textual input and identify sarcastic intent using confidence-based classification. The project focuses on improving human–computer understanding of implicit sentiment, especially sarcasm, which is often difficult to detect using traditional sentiment analysis methods.

The system processes user-entered text and classifies it into three meaningful categories based on confidence scores: Clearly Sarcastic, Non-Sarcastic, and Ambiguous. This layered interpretation provides deeper insight into how confidently sarcasm is expressed, rather than limiting output to a simple binary decision.

Key Features

Real-time sarcasm detection through an interactive web interface

Confidence-based classification instead of yes/no output

Three-level interpretation:

70–100% → Clearly Sarcastic (with explanation)

40–69% → Non-Sarcastic

Below 40% → Ambiguous / unclear intent

Clean, responsive, and user-friendly UI

Research-oriented design aligned with NLP and deep learning concepts

Technology Stack

Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite

Styling: CSS / modern UI components

Deployment: Vercel

Concepts Used: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Confidence Scoring, Sarcasm Analysis

Project Objective

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how sarcasm can be identified more effectively by incorporating confidence scores and interpretability, making the system suitable for academic research, sentiment analysis studies, and human-AI interaction applications.
